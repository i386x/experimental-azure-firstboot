# Configure tuned to use profile "sap-hana"
# force_latency=70 for older tuned versions, hence the script requires appropriate min releases

#### Special recommendations for Power 8
# The On Chip Controller (OCC) controls core frequency. Any tunings for turbo frequency should be done using the 
# Flexible Service Processor Advanced System Management (FSP ASM) page or the IBM Hardware Management Console (HMC) 
# and not from within a PowerVM guest partition. 
# The package pseries-energy must not be installed.  (<== TODO)
# Kindly refer to IBMâ€™s EnergyScale documentation for this feature at http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=POW03125USEN.
